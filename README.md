# Communication Series Part 2 - APB in verilog

I successfully completed the **"Communication Series  - Part 2:
APB in verilog"** course on Namaste FPGA,  Learnt all about the Advanced Peripheral Bus, from APB1 to APB5. Understood the unique features of each version, including wait states, error reporting, and user signaling. Gain practical experience by building APB cores such as GPIO, register, FIFO, and UART. This Course equip me with the essential knowledge and skills to design robust and efficient APB-based systems
